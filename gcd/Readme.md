## 8-bit GCD Calculator

Two 8-bit numbers are given as input as u and v.

Module gcd uses binary gcd algorithm to calculate the gcd

we are using loop to check the conditions of the algorithm.

x and y are two 8-bit registers which we have used to do the calculations

Finally we have stored the result in outp register
