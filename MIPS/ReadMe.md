## Insertion Sort:

We have implemented Insertion Sort in MIPS Assembly Language.
An array of size 10 is taken as input in loop0 and insertion sort is done where loop1 and loop2 signifies the outer loop and inner loop of insertion sort respectively. Finally, the sorted array is printed.

## Fibonacci Series

We have implemented Fibonacci Series in MIPS Assembly Language where we have printed fibonacci numbers upto 500.

## Floating Point Vector

We have implemented Single Precision Floating Point Vector in MIPS Assembly Language where we have printed the required summation of the input floating point numbers. Inputs are taken as floating point numbers in array arr
